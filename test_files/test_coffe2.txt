Brewing coffee at home can be simple or elaborate depending on your equipment and preferences. To make a great cup, start with fresh, high-quality coffee beans and clean water.

1. Measure approximately 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds per 6 ounces of water.
2. Grind the beans just before brewing to preserve flavor; grind size depends on your brewing method (coarse for French press, medium for drip, fine for espresso).
3. Heat water to about 195-205°F (90-96°C). Avoid boiling water directly on the grounds to prevent bitterness.
4. Pour hot water evenly over the grounds, allowing coffee to bloom for 30 seconds if using a pour-over method.
5. Brew time varies: 4 minutes for French press, 5 minutes for drip, 25-30 seconds for espresso.
6. Serve immediately for best taste. Experiment with ratios and grind sizes to find your ideal flavor.

Proper brewing enhances the aroma, taste, and overall coffee experience, turning a simple routine into a delightful ritual.
