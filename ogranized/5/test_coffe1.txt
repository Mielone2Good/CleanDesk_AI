Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, enjoyed by millions every day. Its origins trace back to the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia, where legend says a goat herder discovered the energizing effects of coffee beans. Over centuries, coffee spread through the Arabian Peninsula, becoming central to social and cultural life, especially in Middle Eastern countries.

The coffee bean itself is actually the seed of the coffee cherry, which grows on coffee plants in tropical regions. The two most common species are Arabica and Robusta, each with distinct flavors and caffeine levels. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild taste, while Robusta has a stronger, more bitter profile and higher caffeine content.

Today, coffee culture varies globallyâ€”from Italian espresso bars to American drip coffee shops and Japanese coffee ceremonies. Beyond its taste, coffee acts as a social catalyst, bringing people together for conversation and connection.
