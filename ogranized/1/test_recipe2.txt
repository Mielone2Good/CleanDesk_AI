Overview:
Making sourdough bread is a process that requires patience and attention but yields delicious results with a crispy crust and chewy interior.

Ingredients:

500g bread flour

350ml water

100g active sourdough starter

10g salt

Procedure:

Mix flour and water in a large bowl until just combined. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes (autolyse).

Add sourdough starter and salt, then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.

Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, folding the dough every hour.

Shape the dough into a boule, place in a floured banneton basket, and let proof for 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 250°C (482°F) with a Dutch oven inside. Transfer dough to Dutch oven, score the surface, cover, and bake for 20 minutes.

Remove lid and bake for an additional 25 minutes until golden brown. Cool before slicing.
