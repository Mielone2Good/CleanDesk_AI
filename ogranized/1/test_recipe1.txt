Document 1: Classic Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe

Ingredients:

200g spaghetti

100g pancetta, diced

2 large eggs

50g grated Parmesan cheese

2 cloves garlic, peeled

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon olive oil

Instructions:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and reserve 1 cup of pasta water.

While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add garlic cloves and pancetta, cooking until crispy. Remove garlic cloves.

In a bowl, beat eggs and mix with Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.

Toss hot pasta into the pan with pancetta, remove from heat, then quickly stir in the egg mixture, adding reserved pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.

Serve immediately with extra Parmesan and pepper.
